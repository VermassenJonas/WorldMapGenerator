# WorldMapGenerator
An RPG-oriented planetary surface generator. Main focus will be icosahedral projections, as they are easy to hex-grid, and relatively spherical. Map generation will use a variant on the diamond-square algorithm, and a zoom for additional detail will be supported. That's the plan at least.
